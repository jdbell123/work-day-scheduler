## Reason

The reason for this assignment this week was to learn jQuery logic. We were given the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria:

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Learnt

Working on this project I have learnt about the following things:

    1 - Mostly learned about jQuery
    2 - Learned how to use Luxon date functions
    3 - Expanded knowledge on JavaScript
    4 - Learned how to store things in localStorage and retreive them back when the page reloads

## Take-Aways

Planning is key. Do plenty of research on things you are not sure about and display things via the console.log command to learn about the data they return.
